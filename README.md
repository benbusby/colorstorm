:art: *Code editor themes inspired by the bizarre locations from the SNES game [Earthbound (aka Mother 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound).*
___
The current themes are: earthbound, moonside, threed, magicant (light theme), and cave of the past (monochromatic), each modeled after an iconic location in the game. You can view the color palette for each theme below, or go straight to the screenshots. 

All color themes follow the AA/AAA color accessibility guidelines for all font sizes, and provide unique, colorful syntax highlighting for a variety of editors.

Contributions are highly encouraged, as there are plenty of editors out there that I don't use but would like to support with these themes.
