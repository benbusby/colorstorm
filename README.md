## Current Themes
- Earthbound
- Moonside
- Zombie Threed
- Dusty Dunes
- Fire Spring
- Magicant (Light Theme)
- Cave of the Past (Monochromatic Theme)

Each theme is modeled after an iconic location in the game, and all color themes follow the AA/AAA color accessibility guidelines for all font sizes.

### "Darker" Themes
- Earthbound Darker
- Zombie Threed Darker
- Dusty Dunes Darker
- Fire Spring Darker

These themes are nearly identical to their "regular" theme counterparts, but use a darker background to provide a higher contrast alternative with the syntax colors.
